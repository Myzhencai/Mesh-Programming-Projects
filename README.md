Following folder contains 3d geometry and mesh manipulation projects. In other words, we change a triangular mesh from one form to another.

3D Mesh Transformation: Transform one mesh to another. This is used to generate animations from one mesh to other.



3D Mesh Reconstruction : Here we have a point cloud and we apply two different algorithm to get a structure out of it.

3D Mesh Remashing : A mesh needs more number of 3D points where curvature is high and less for planar surface. Remashing removes the redundant 3D points

3D Mesh Smoothing : Smooth a mesh and create a more uniform mesh as we high contrast from our pictures

3D Mesh Stiching: Matching one mesh to another, change orientation of one mesh towards other until we get best fit.
